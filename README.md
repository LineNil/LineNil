### Hello 👋
Welcome to my page!
I'm Line, a Front End developer in training from Norway 🇳🇴. I'm currently a student at Noroff University College and looking forward to starting my exciting developer's journey 👩‍💻.
Apart from coding, I love design and searching for inspiration for future projects. I also love to spend a lot of time with my family. 👨‍👩‍👧.
Thanks for visiting, and I'd love to connect😁!

## Languages and tools I know so far and continue to learn more about.
